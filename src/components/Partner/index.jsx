               <p class="sub-title">
               Percentage of rent due that we collect each month. This is due to a very tight applicant screening process, a time-tested internal collection process, and the fact that we have a full-time Director of Accounting (Caleb Mokaya) whose only job is to ensure our residents pay on-time each month.

               <h3 class="title">72% Retention</h3>
               <p>
               The percentage of our tenants that renew their leases every year. This is important because turnover leads to vacancy – which is the biggest expense you could potentially have as a landlord. More lease renewals leads to less turnover, which results in fewer expenses for you!

Should you ever find our services lacking, you can terminate our agreement with a simple 30-day notice; and with no termination fees or penalties.
